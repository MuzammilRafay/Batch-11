html tags
<p>This is a paragraph </p>


div html tag is like a box


there are two types of elements
1-block element
A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).


2-inline-block element
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets



id is used for selecting specific/unique element (1 par use hoga just)

class is used for common element (1 se zada par use hoga)


in css we use # for id & . for class



margin = element k bahar se space deta ha
margin:20px = charo taraf se hoga space
margin-top = sirf top se space hoga

padding = element k andar se space deta ha
padding:20px = charo taraf se hoga space
padding-top = sirf top se space hoga


* = all elements

float = terna
